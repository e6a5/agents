# AGENTS.md

**Why AGENTS.md?**

*README.md* files are for humans: quick starts, project descriptions, and contribution guidelines.

*AGENTS.md* complements this by containing the extra, sometimes detailed context coding agents need: build steps, tests, and conventions that might clutter a README or aren’t relevant to human contributors.

We intentionally kept it separate to:

Give agents a clear, predictable place for instructions.

Keep READMEs concise and focused on human contributors.

Provide precise, agent-focused guidance that complements existing README and docs.

Rather than introducing another proprietary file, we chose a name and format that could work for anyone. If you’re building or using coding agents and find this helpful, feel free to adopt it.
